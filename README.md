An exercise in detailed module design! Includes the code and design document

This was a group project I completed in my second year of Software Engineering at McMaster University. 
This was for a detailed design course in which we wrote a module design document for our program. There was a big focus on OO design, and therefore we chose to develop in Java. 
In the module design document you will find a class decomposition rationale, an MIS and MID for each module, and a traceability section that shows we followed all the requirements
 given in our assignment.
